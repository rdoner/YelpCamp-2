# YelpCamp-2

This was the first full website that I made as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. 
It is a user-sourced directory of campsites with user authentication for posting new campsites, making comments, and editing posts. 
The google maps API is used to add a map of the location in the campsite information. 
YelpCamp was built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, mLab, and PassportJS
I built this blog app to learn how to use the react-router library. 
It makes REST API calls to a blog database. Then, once information has been fetched from the database, 
it uses the redux library to manage the blog data so that it is loaded instantaneously.
